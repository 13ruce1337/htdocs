- *smdh took me until now DRINK*
- *Controller* - for some reason the select a character page queries for ever character in the database but only shows values if the username matches for the character

####Version 0.2.0(2/22/14)
- *Model* - after updating level on the character sheet, the modifier values do not update. thus rending the page false. you must refresh the page to reload the page from the previous page to get the proper values
- *Controller* - after double clicking the attribute you wish to change, the input box pops up any and everywhere!
- *View* - really hard to click on stuff
